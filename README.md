# Introduction
This repository is aimed at Python users who want to switch to Julia language

# Instructions
1. To download this repository, use the **Clone or download** button (the green one) or clone it with **Git CLI**.
2. There is a slideshow in which I have covered the following topics:
  - Introduction to Julia
  - An overview of Julia's features and comparison with Python
  - Installing Julia & Julia's IDE
  - Using Julia's package manager
  - Using Julia in Python
2. Inside ***Notebooks*** directory you will find multiple Jupyter notebooks which you can check them online or download to use them on your local system. Each notebook covers a specific aspect of Julia. The material for these notebooks are a summary of Julia's documentation which you can access from [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/).
3. Inside ***Examples*** directory you will find some examples written in Julia, such as a News Crawler which you may find handy in your ML projects. Check them out from time to time as I will try to add more sample codes in future.
